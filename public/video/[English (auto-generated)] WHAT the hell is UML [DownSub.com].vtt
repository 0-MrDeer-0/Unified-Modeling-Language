00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.439
uml stands for unified modeling language

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:04.319
and it is used

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.359
heavily when designing computer systems

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:10.559
large and small and it looks like

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.559
this a lot of boxes and arrows with some

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:15.679
text in it

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.560
so how it is a language and how do we

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:19.279
use it

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.540
hi i am smok and this is quick answer

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.590
[Music]

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.119
by no means think that this is a full

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.399
introduction to uml

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.640
it's like trying to teach c plus in five

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.760
minutes or less

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.920
i'll make a full deep dive video

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.960
sometime soon

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.239
so make sure you subscribe uml is a

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.280
formal language

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.680
authors claim that each element of

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.559
language has

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.760
a strongly defined meaning it's

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.879
concise uses straightforward and

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.920
simple notation and its pass through

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.640
all important aspects of describing a

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.600
system

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.640
so why would you choose uml over

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.760
something else though well uml is an

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.880
open standard

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.360
that isn't controlled by any specific

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.240
vendor

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.439
this means that you can learn it and be

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.640
understood around the real world uml has

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.439
this feature

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:19.840
being understood precisely you can't go

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.600
wrong with uml like you can't go wrong

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.320
with a word

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.560
date you can have a date with someone

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.600
eat a date food

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.680
have a date of birth or date something

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.119
as old

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.400
uml is not ambiguous and that

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.520
is important uml offers these different

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.400
flavors

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.520
different views logical process

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.960
development physical and use case view

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.360
these describe different aspects of

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.159
software

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.720
how it's structured how it works how

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.920
it's organized

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.560
how it's located on servers and of

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.280
course

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.320
how it is used logical view

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.960
has the biggest family of diagrams and

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.719
these are usually known as

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.799
actual uml diagrams in the software

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.479
development world

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.119
in here you'll find class diagrams

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.479
showing hierarchy

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.760
fields methods interfaces relations

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.200
and all that object diagrams describing

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.640
situations in the live system and

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.120
sequence diagrams explaining how

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.000
elements

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.959
interact over time also there are

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:25.760
communication

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.319
timing and composite diagrams there are

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.160
a lot of details here

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.480
but out of the scope of this video

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.840
process view contains

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.239
activity diagrams that describe how

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.040
things are done

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.080
in your system execution starts at

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.239
the entry point usually marked with

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.519
black circle

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.920
each step of the algorithm is in a

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.879
rounded box

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:49.360
and diamond indicates a control

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.319
structure

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:53.360
if while or four system

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.760
follows the arrows until it reaches the

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.120
final node

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.840
black circle with an additional outline

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.480
i know

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.319
i know very complex development view

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.400
is about organizing your system into

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.239
modules and components

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.080
there are two notations both of them

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.080
describe what interface component

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.200
provides

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.319
which it requires and

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.519
what artifacts make up a component

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.080
physical view is used to show how the

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.879
system is

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:26.239
structured on hardware deploy diagrams

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.760
show nodes or simply physical or virtual

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.640
machines

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.080
that host our service list of deployed

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.400
artifacts is visible on every node

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.959
and they are connected with each other

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:39.760
to show

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.360
what interfaces are used between them

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.640
use case view is used to simplify and

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.040
standardize customer requirements

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.560
originally written

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.519
in some natural language to something

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:54.400
distilled

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.040
and unified that can be used by

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.239
developers

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.360
to quickly get familiar with overall

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.120
behavior of the system

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.400
and key use cases these views make up

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.680
the uml language

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.840
as you can tell there is much more than

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:10.879
miss di

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:13.120
subscribe and i'll see you in the next

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.020
one cheers
